# Readymade

Install ready-made distribution images!

It is created as a replacement to Red Hat's [Anaconda](https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda) installer for Ultramarine Linux and tauOS after many complaints about the poor UX design of Anaconda, and the lack of working alternative installers for RPM-based distributions.

Right now this is a work in progress, and Readymade will simply be a frontend for [systemd-repart](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/249/systemd-repart.html).

Work on a dedicated backend for Readymade is planned.

## Hacking

Please refer to [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for more information on how to contribute to Readymade.

## Naming

As the convention of making up codenames for system components after J-Pop references, we have decided to name the installer after Ado's single, [Readymade](https://youtu.be/jg09lNupc1s), which happens to have a cool meaning to it as this installer essentially installs ready-made squashfs images.
