# filesystem-table-rs

A rust library for reading and writing filesystem tables, supporting `fstab` and `mtab` formats.

The Filesystem Table format is a very simple TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format that is used to describe filesystems and their mount points. The format is used by the `fstab` and `mtab` files on Unix systems.

See [fstab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab) and [mtab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mtab) on Wikipedia for more information.
